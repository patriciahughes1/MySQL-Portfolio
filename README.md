✈️ **Flying High: Analyzing Key Drivers of Passenger Satisfaction in Airline Customer Service**

In this case study I plan to demonstrate my skills, including data exploration, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, to uncover actionalbe insightsthat can enhance the customer experience. This case study wil explore and identify the main factors influencing airline passenger satisfaction. 

By using MySQL for data querying and manipulation, I will conducting and end-to-end analysis. I will go through exploring satisfaction drivers and demographic trends to building a predictive model to classify customer satisfaction. 

## Problem Statement
The airline industry is heavily reliant on delivering excellent customer service to maintain customer loyalty and satisfaction, particularly given its highly competitive landscape. Customer satisfaction influences customer retention, brand reputation, and overall business profitability. This case study seeks to address the question: What are the main factors contributing to passenger satisfaction or dissatisfaction?

### Objective:
1. **Identify Key Satisfaction Drivers:** Determine which aspects of the customer experience (e.g., seat comfort, inflight Wi-Fi, food and drink quality) are most strongly associated with high levels of passenger satisfaction.
2. **Understand Satisfaction Patterns Across Demographics and Customer Types:** Examine how satisfaction varies across demographic groups (such as age and gender) and by customer type (loyal vs. disloyal) to gain insights into the preferences of different passenger segments.
3. **Explore the Impact of Operational Factors:** Assess the effect of flight distance, delays, and class of travel (Business, Economy, Eco Plus) on satisfaction levels to see if operational variables directly influence customer perceptions.
4. **Predictive Modeling for Satisfaction:** Build a predictive model capable of classifying a passenger’s satisfaction level based on the collected survey responses and operational data. This will demonstrate the potential to predict and respond to passenger needs proactively.

### Key Questions:
* **What customer experience factors have the strongest correlation with overall passenger satisfaction?** Identifying these key factors can help focus improvement efforts on the most influential aspects of the passenger experience.
* **How does passenger satisfaction vary by customer type and demographic?** By segmenting satisfaction levels by variables like customer type, age, and travel purpose, the analysis can reveal valuable insights about targeted service improvements.
* **To what extent do operational delays and flight class impact satisfaction?** Understanding the role of delays and class type will highlight potential areas where operational changes could positively affect customer satisfaction.
* **Can passenger satisfaction be predicted based on survey responses and other data?** A predictive model can serve as a valuable tool for anticipating customer sentiment and preparing service teams to meet or exceed passenger expectations.
