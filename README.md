# Problem Statement
Objective: Identify key factors impacting passenger satisfaction and explore patterns in the data that could help improve the airlineâ€™s service.
Key Questions:
Which features (e.g., flight distance, seat comfort) are most strongly correlated with passenger satisfaction?
How do satisfaction drivers vary across customer types, age groups, or travel purposes?
Can you create a predictive model to classify passenger satisfaction based on these variables?
